# Pong
Classic Pong game using DE1-SOC.

Pong follows the gameplay of the classic Table-Tennis game that is played between two players. Each player controls a paddle to deflect the ball onto the opponentâ€™s area. The game utilizes an external peripheral camera module, touch screen, push buttons and slide switches of the DE1-SOC to accommodate multiple user inputs complimented by the use of text and image to display different output scenarios of the game. In order to increase efficiency, the game was conceived on two different DE1-SOC boards: Master and Slave. The two players control their respective paddles via two different methods. Player one controls their game-paddle by moving a red coloured object in front of a camera i.e. a red racquet and the second player controls their game-paddle with the help of two push buttons on the DE1-SOC board.
